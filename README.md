# CS-350

What did you do particularly well?
The thing I felt I did well in was constructing a clear and concise code. This was done through the use of comments to help section of the code making it easier to problem-solve and hit all of the required parts of the project. 

Where could you improve?
Things I could improve on are being more thorough when reading the requirements and project description I found a lot of my initial mistakes came from me rushing through the project instead of taking my time to really ingest what was needed from me.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding regular expressions to my toolkit. As a challenge faced when producing the code was input validation, as it required a lot of conditional statements and error checking. I found researching my error codes led me to forums that helped get me on the right track. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
The skills that I have developed in writing well-documented and readable code will be something that I can transfer to my future projects. Things like input validation and error-handling techniques can be useful for any project that requires user input or interaction. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Focusing on keeping my code properly indented and having enough space between each section of my code made it more readable, maintainable, and adaptable.
